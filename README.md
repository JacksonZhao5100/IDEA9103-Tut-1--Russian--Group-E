### Introduction
The artwork that we chose is Apple Tree by Anwar Jalal Shemza.
Apple Tree was created in 1962, which is a part of exploration of organic forms. In Apple Tree, Anwar uses repeated circular and linear patterns to represent the structure of tree, which created a sense of balance and rhythm. The same characteristics also shown in other artworks by Anwar such as:

Composition in Red and Green, 1963.
Meem Two 1967.
Apple Trees, 1970.
Composition with a Number Six, 1966

The reason that Apple Tree has been chosen is because it can be created in the same method with Generate Art, which uses simple geometric shapes to create nature stuff, which inspired us to using simple shapes and lines to show the nature stuffs in coding. Also, this concept helps us understand how to use code to generate the structural layout of branches and leaves. Similarly, we will use the concept of generative art to repeat the lines of branches and leaves to build the complexity of the work.
Moreover, the nature elements such as trees has a procedure of grow up, which gives the chance to create the iteration of the form of our works.

In the coding part, I plan to create a drawing class which contain the single element in structure of Apple Tree that created by draw function such as: drawCircles() or drawLines().
These circles will be separated in several classes which includes Circle in trunk structure, Circle in branch structure and Circle and rectangle in bottom structure. Then use for loop to repeat the simple patterns in different classes to organize the main structure of artwork. Finally use the coding in WEEK9 lecture and tutorial such as easing and translate to creating animate for our work. The animate could be a grow process of the Apple Tree, which can be created by using translate and scale functions. The animate can also be the process of apple fall from the tree, which use rotate and translate functions.
